Expected Output:

Printing current and previous number sum in a given range(10)
Current Number 0 Previous Number  0  Sum:  0
Current Number 1 Previous Number  0  Sum:  1
Current Number 2 Previous Number  1  Sum:  3
Current Number 3 Previous Number  2  Sum:  5
Current Number 4 Previous Number  3  Sum:  7
Current Number 5 Previous Number  4  Sum:  9
Current Number 6 Previous Number  5  Sum:  11
Current Number 7 Previous Number  6  Sum:  13
Current Number 8 Previous Number  7  Sum:  15
Current Number 9 Previous Number  8  Sum:  17
